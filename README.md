# API Design Best Practices

This document outlines best practices for designing robust, efficient, and user-friendly APIs. Following these principles ensures your API is scalable, secure, and maintainable.

---

## 1. Follow RESTful Principles
- **Statelessness**: Each request must contain all the information needed to process it.
- **Resources and URIs**:
  - Use nouns to represent resources in the URL (e.g., `/users` instead of `/getUsers`).
- **HTTP Methods**:
  - `GET`: Retrieve data.
  - `POST`: Create a new resource.
  - `PUT/PATCH`: Update an existing resource.
  - `DELETE`: Remove a resource.

---

## 2. Use Consistent Naming Conventions
- Use **camelCase** or **snake_case** for JSON keys.
- Stick to a consistent naming convention (e.g., `/users` or `/user`, not both).

---

## 3. Version Your API
- Include a version in the API URL (e.g., `/api/v1/users`).
- Alternatively, use headers for versioning to avoid breaking changes.

---

## 4. Provide Clear and Meaningful Responses
- Use proper HTTP status codes:
  - `200 OK`: Successful request.
  - `201 Created`: Resource created.
  - `400 Bad Request`: Client error.
  - `401 Unauthorized`: Authentication required.
  - `404 Not Found`: Resource not found.
  - `500 Internal Server Error`: Server error.
- Include error details in the response body:
  ```json
  {
    "error": "Invalid input",
    "details": "The 'email' field must be a valid email address."
  }
